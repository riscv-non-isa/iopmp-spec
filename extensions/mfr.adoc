=== Multi-Faults Record

A first violation is one that is detected and logged in the error report. However, since the error report can only accommodate one first violation, any additional violations that are detected but not logged in the error report are termed as subsequent violations. The issue at hand is that these subsequent violations become completely invisible.

The extension is used to record which RRIDs make subsequent violations. The extension maintains a bit, referred to as SV[_s_], for each RRID _s_. When one or more subsequent violations are issued from an RRID, the corresponding bit is set.

To retrieve these SVs, a 32-bit register *ERR_MFR* is used. Every 16 contiguous SVs are grouped together into a record window, which is indexed by a 12-bit field, *svi*. When *ERR_MFR* is read, the IOPMP sequentially scans all record windows towards the last window from original position (*svi*) until a violation is found. Once the last available record window is scanned, the next record window to be scanned is the first record window (i.e., SV[0] ~ SV[15]). The original position can be set by writing an index of record window to *svi*. If found, the status bit *svs* is set, and *svi* indexes the window containing the first found set SV. The 16-bit field *svw* reflects the record window indexed by *svi*, where *svw[_j_]*=SV[*svi* * 16 + _j_]. After the register is read out, all bits in the record window are cleared. If not found, *svs* and *svw* return zeros and *svi* keeps the same. Moreover, the bit *svc* in the *ERR_INFO* indicates if any subsequent violation is in the log.

The read only bit *HWCFG0.mfr_en* indicates if the IOPMP implements the extension.
