[#NON_PRIORITY_ENTRIES]
=== Non-priority IOPMP entries

The extension enables non-priority entries to reduce latency, power consumption, and area. It can also be used together with the priority entries to achieve a balance between security and performance.

When the extension is enabled, entries with indices greater than or equal to *HWCFG2.prio_entry* are non-prioritized. These are treated equally and assigned the lowest priority. Entries with indices less than *prio_entry* are prioritized. The value of *prio_entry* is implementation-dependent. Additionally, a field *HWCFG2.prient_prog* indicates whether *prio_entry* is programmable.

[NOTE]
====
Priority entries safeguard the most sensitive data, even in the event of secure software being compromised. However, implementing a large number of priority entries results in higher latency and increased area usage. In contrast,non-priority entries are treated equally and can be cached in smaller numbers. A mix of entry types provides flexibility in balancing security and performance.
====

An entry qualifies as a matching entry with the extension for an incoming transaction if:

* For priority entries, its region covers any byte of the transaction,
* For non-priority entries, its region covers all bytes of the transaction,
* It is associated with the RRID carried by the transaction; and
* It holds the highest priority among entries that meet the previous criteria.

[NOTE]
====
Multiple matching entries are allowed for non-priority entries because they share the lowest priority.

[NOTE]
====
IOPMPs don't report error type = 0x04 "Partial hit on a priority rule" on non-priority entries because non-priority entries must covers all bytes of the transaction.

If one matching entry is priority, the reaction is the same as baseline IOPMP entry array.

If one matching entry is non-priority, the transaction is legal if any matching entry permits its access type. If no matching entry permits, the transaction is illegal with error type = "illegal read access" (0x01) for read access transaction or "illegal write access/AMO" (0x02) for write access/AMO transaction. If an IOPMP supports instruction fetch permission check (*HWCFG2.chk_x* = 1), the IOPMP reports illegal instruction fetch transaction with with error type = "illegal instruction fetch" (0x03).

For an illegal transaction matching multiple non-priority entries, if the interrupt is triggered or the bus error response is returned, *ERR_REQID.eid* stores the index of any of them.
