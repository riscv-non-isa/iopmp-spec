=== Transaction Stalling

This section introduces an extension to stall transations by RRIDs and describes how to use the extension to update IOPMP's settings in runtime.

At times, attempting to configuring all IOPMP settings when the system starts can be difficult or even impossible, especially before I/O agents are active or connected to the system. As a result, it is necessary to update IOPMP settings during runtime. 

To configure all IOPMP settings during runtime, security software without the extension can 
configure additional MDs for different settings in MDCFG Table and entry array, and switch the associated MDs for an RRID in SRCMD Table from a single access.

[NOTE]
The aforementioned method is not applicable if an IOPMP supports number of MD greater than 31 and its control port only supports 32-bit access. Security software needs two accesses to switch the association in the configuration. It results incomplete setting between the first access and the second access and potentially create a vulnerability.

However, the aforementioned method may not be suitable for certain systems. Another method to update IOPMP settings is necessary. This may occur when a device is enabled, disabled, added, removed, or when the accessible area of a device changes. When updating, it is important to avoid checking transactions in an incomplete setting. However, updating IOPMP settings often involves a series of control accesses, and if a transaction check occurs during the update, it can potentially create a vulnerability. 
It could be a heavy burden for the security software to guarantee that no transactions are in progress from all related initiators. This extension enables the method for updating IOPMP's settings that avoids checking transactions in an incomplete setting and burdening the security software.


==== Atomicity Requirement
The Atomicity Requirement is that when updating an IOPMP, all transactions from receiver ports must be checked either before any changes are made or after all changes are completed. Essentially, checking a transaction in a partial setting should be avoided. The succeeding sections will describe the mechanism that helps the security software satisfy this requirement.

[#PROGRAMMING_STEPS]
==== Programming Steps
The general approach for a security software to the atomicity requirement has three major steps, conceptually described as follows:

** Step 1: Stall the related transactions that the following updates may impact.
** Step 2: Update IOPMP's settings.
** Step 3: Resume the transactions stalled in Step 1.

Stalling a transaction means the IOPMP stops checking its permission until it is resumed. In the meantime, the transaction should wait. For Step 1, it might be necessary to verify if the stalling has occurred since some implementations could not immediately stall the desired transactions from receiver ports. Following this, execute the IOPMP updates as Step 2, and finally, resume all stalled transactions in Step 3.

[NOTE]
====
In some cases, Step 1 and Step 3 may be skipped as long as no transaction check is performed within Step 2. Writing the SRCMD of an RRID is an example because it involves a single write.
====

NOTE: Stalling a transaction could be implemented in the following ways but not limited to: (1) IOPMP may enqueue the transactions to stall but not be checked, (2) ask the transaction initiator to retry the transaction by a retry message, and (3) enqueue first and ask to retry if the queue is full.

[#STALL_TRANSACTIONS]
==== Stall Transactions
For Step 1, it's possible to postpone all transactions until all updates are finished. However, this could cause unrelated transactions to experience unnecessary delays. This might not be tolerable for devices that require low latency, like a display controller that periodically retrieves a frame from its video buffer. This section explains the mechanism that only stalls specific transactions to prevent the aforementioned scenario and ensure the atomicity requirement. All the features mentioned below are optional.

In Step 2, the decision of whether a transaction should be stalled cannot reference the current settings because these settings are under updating. Therefore, the only reliable information for this decision is the RRID carried by the transaction. To simplify the following descriptions, we use _rrid_stall_ to represent an abstract bit array, where _rrid_stall_[_s_] = 1 indicates that transactions with RRID _s_ must be stalled. The IOPMP stalls a transaction based on its corresponding _rrid_stall_. Please note that it may not be an actual bit array in practice just for easier expression and is not directly accessible by software.

Register *MDSTALL* and *MDSTALLH* control _rrid_stall_. *MDSTALL.md* and *MDSTALLH.mdh* are used to select MDs. Denote _stall_by_md_ to represent the concatenation of *MDSTALL.mdh* and *MDSTALL.md*. That is, _stall_by_md_[30:0] is *MDSTALL.md[30:0]*, and _stall_by_md_[62:31] is *MDSTALLH.mdh[31:0]* if any. An MD _m_ is selected when _stall_by_md_[_m_] = 1. *MDSTALL.exempt* controls the polarity of the selection. An IOPMP updates _rrid_stall_ only when *MDSTALL.exempt* is written. When *MDSTALL.exempt* is written to 0, _rrid_stall_[_s_] is set if RRID _s_ is associated with a selected MD _m_ (_stall_by_md_[_m_] = 1). The SRCMD Table defines the association of RRID _s_ and MD _m_. Conversely, when *MDSTALL.exempt* is written to 1, _rrid_stall_[_s_] must be set if RRID _s_ is not associated with any selected MD. This relation can be formulated as follows:

[.text-center]
`_rrid_stall_[_s_] <= MDSTALL.exempt ^ ( Reduction_OR (SRCMD(_s_).md & _stall_by_md_));`

Where:

* ^ is bitwise logical exclusive OR operator, 
* & is bitwise logical AND operator, and
* Reduction_OR() is a function that applies bitwise logical OR across all input values.

// NOTE:
// Removed description about SRCMD Table Format 2.

For any unimplemented MD, the corresponding bit in *MDSTALL.md* or *MDSTALLH.mdh* should be wired to 0.

_rrid_stall_ should be updated only when *MDSTALL.exempt* is written, that is, when *MDSTALL* is written. When *MDSTALLH* is written, the only action is to hold the value.

NOTE: Although _rrid_stall_ is derived from the SRCMD Table, it should be updated only when *MDSTALL.exempt* is written. We cannot use the table when stalling transactions because the table updates may still be in progress when the IOPMP decides if a transaction should be stalled. Writing *MDSTALL* is just like capturing a snapshot of the table at the moment right before updating any settings. The _rrid_stall_ reflects the SRCMD Table before any updates. 

NOTE: When writing *MDSTALL*, the specification only defines the transactions with RRID=_s_ must be stalled for all _rrid_stall_[_s_] = 1. It doesn't request the rest of the transactions to stall or not. It only asks that all transactions be resumed when writing *MDSTALL* with a zero.

==== Cherry Pick
Writing *RRIDSCP* register is an optional substep after writing *MDSTALL* within Step 1 of <<#PROGRAMMING_STEPS, Programming Steps>>. One can select or deselect the transactions with specific RRIDs to stall if the previous writing *MDSTALL*/*MDSTALLH* doesn't stall all the desired transactions. One can write the register zero or multiple times in the substep.

[NOTE]
====
*MDSTALL*/*MDSTALLH* only stall the RRIDs based on the SRCMD Table at the moment of writing *MDSTALL*. _rrid_stall_ is not updated when the SRCMD Table is updated. Besides, _rrid_stall_ is set or clear only for those RRIDs associated with given MDs. The RRIDSCP is used to fine-tune the _rrid_stall_ if writing *MDSTALL*/*MDSTALLH* doesn't fulfill the desired _rrid_stall_ values.
Software should, whenever possible, prioritize using the *MDSTALL*/*MDSTALLH* batch mechanism to manage the _rrid_stall_ state. While RRIDSCP offers granular control, it introduces significant software complexity. Its use is primarily intended for complex scenarios where the MD-based grouping logic of *MDSTALL* is insufficient to precisely define the set of RRIDs that must be stalled or exempted.
====

The *RRIDSCP* register comprises two fields: a 2-bit *RRIDSCP.op* and a field for *RRIDSCP.rrid*. By setting *RRIDSCP.op* = 1, the _rrid_stall_[_s_] is set for _s_ = *RRIDSCP.rrid*. Conversely, by setting *RRIDSCP.op* = 2, the _rrid_stall_[_s_] is clear for _s_ = *RRIDSCP.rrid*. This register is used to fine-tune the result of writing *MDSTALL*/*MDSTALLH*. The writing *RRIDSCP.op* = 0 querys the value of _rrid_stall_[_s_] for a valid _s_. The value will be returned in the two most significant bits in the following reading *RRIDSCP*. *RRIDSCP.op*=3 is reserved.

[#FAULTING_STALLED_TRANSACTIONS]
==== Faulting stalled transactions
Faulting stalled transactions can be allowed. To allow faulting over stalling when an IOPMP cannot accommodate more stalled transactions, such as when the receiver port lacks a buffer for transaction storage, set *ERR_CFG.stall_violation_en* to 1 before Step 1 of <<#PROGRAMMING_STEPS, Programming Steps>>. If any transaction is faulted due to the stalled transactions, the error information shall be logged in *ERR_INFO*, where *ERR_INFO.etype* = 0x07 (error due to stalled transactions). The procedure for faulting checking transactions is identical to Steps 1-3 of <<#PROGRAMMING_STEPS, Programming Steps>>, except that, besides stalling and delaying the transactions, transactions can be faulted and cannot be resumed if the IOPMP can't handle more stalled transactions.

[NOTE]
====
In certain implementations, rather than stalling the related transactions, the system may opt to fault the checking transactions during an IOPMP atomic update. Faulting transactions can be advantageous if the system lacks sufficient buffer capacity to record and store all transactions during the IOPMP programming process.

This function also can prevent the risk of deadlock in some systems. If an implementation or a system doesn't have sufficient buffer capacity for handling all stalled transactions during programming, the stalled transactions may backpressure from receiver port of the IOPMP and then occur hang on the port due to its implementation limitation. Therefore, the hang on the port potentially causes a deadlock in the system since transactions for programming IOPMP during Step 2 and Step 3 of <<#PROGRAMMING_STEPS, Programming Steps>> have the possibility to hang indirectly in the circumstance. 
====

==== Resume Stall

In order to resume all stalled transactions, the IOPMP can be prompted by writing 0 to *MDSTALL*. This corresponds to Step 3 of <<#PROGRAMMING_STEPS, Programming Steps>>.  After *MDSTALL* is written by zero, an IOPMP should clear *MDSTALL.is_busy* within some time, at which point all transactions have been resumed.

==== The Order to Stall
In Step 1 of <<#PROGRAMMING_STEPS, Programming Steps>>, *MDSTALL* can be written at most once and before a resume. Writing a non-zero value to *MDSTALL* multiple times after a resume leads to RRIDs' stall states being undefined.

After *MDSTALL* and all *RRIDSCP* are written, the action to stall desired transactions may not take effect immediately in some implementations in which the subsequent setting updates (Step 2) could affect the transactions still under checking. To determine whether the action takes effect, one can read back and check the bit *MDSTALL.is_busy*, which is in the same location as *MDSTALL.exempt* on a write. *is_busy* = 0 indicates it has taken effect or no previous write; otherwise, it has not. A new writing *RRIDSCP* may temporarily switch *is_busy* to 1 and then switch to 0 at some time.
*is_busy* can be wired to 0 if any *MDSTALL* and *RRIDSCP* writing won't cause a race condition of the transactions still under checking and the subsequent setting updates.

Based on <<#PROGRAMMING_STEPS, Programming Steps>>, complete steps to program an IOPMP should be followed.

** Step 1.1: write *MDSTALL* once // exactly once
** Step 1.2: write *RRIDSCP* zero or more times
** Step 1.3: poll until *MDSTALL.is_busy* == 0 // to ensure all stalls takes effect if necessary for the implementation
** Step 2: update IOPMP's settings
** Step 3.1: write *MDSTALL* = 0 // resume all transactions
** Step 3.2: poll until *MDSTALL.is_busy* == 0  // optional, to ensure all resumes take effect. 

Some steps may be skipped according to the actual implementation.

==== Implementation Options

*HWCFG2.stall_en* indicates if the IOPMP implements the extension, which are *MDSTALL*, *MDSTALLH*, *RRIDSCP*, *ERR_CFG.stall_violation_en*, and additional error type = 0x07 "error due to a stalled transaction".

All registers and fields described in xref:Program_IOPMPs[xrefstyle=full] (*MDSTALL*, *MDSTALLH*, *RRIDSCP*, and *ERR_CFG.stall_violation_en*) are optional. Moreover, these features could be partially implemented.

In *MDSTALL.md* and *MDSTALLH.mdh*, not every bit should be implemented even though the corresponding MD is implemented. An unimplemented bit means unselectable and should be wired to zero. To test which bits are implemented, one can write all 1's to *MDSTALL.md* and *MDSTALLH.mdh* and then read them back. An implemented bit returns 1.

If an IOPMP implementation has fewer than 32 memory domains, *MDSTALLH* should be wired to zero.

NOTE: An example of partial implementation of *MDSTALL.md*/*MDSTALLH.mdh* is a system with a display controller, which is a latency-sensitive device. On updating the IOPMP, the transactions initiated from the display controller should not be stalled. Thus, one can always use *MDSTALL.exempt*=1 and *MDSTALL.md[_j_]*=1, where MD _j_ is the memory domain for the frame buffer that the display controller keeps accessing. Thus, the system only needs to implement *MDSTALL.md[_j_]*.

*MDSTALL.is_busy* can be wired to 0 if any *MDSTALL* and *RRIDSCP* writing won't cause a race condition of the transactions still under checking and the subsequent setting updates.

If whole *MDSTALL* is not implemented, *MDSTALL*, *MDSTALLH*, *RRIDSCP* and *ERR_CFG.stall_violation_en* should always return zero.

If *RRIDSCP* is not implemented, it always returns zero. One can test if it is implemented by writing a zero and then reading it back. Any IOPMP implementing *RRIDSCP* should not return a zero in *RRIDSCP.stat* in this case.

It is unnecessary to allow every implemented RRID to be selectable by *RRIDSCP.rrid*. If an unimplemented or unselectable RRID is written into *RRIDSCP.rrid*, it returns *RRIDSCP.stat* = 3.

*ERR_CFG.stall_violation_en* is a WARL field so it can be programmable or fixed.
