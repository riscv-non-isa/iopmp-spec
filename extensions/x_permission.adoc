=== Instruction Fetch Permission Check

The IOPMP specification provides instruction fetch permission checking. This extension enables protection of executable (x) memory regions by controlling instruction fetch transaction authorization.

When instruction fetch checking is enabled (*HWCFG2.chk_x* = 1), the *ENTRY_CFG(_i_)* register contains the *x* field for instruction fetch permission, which is WARL (Write-Any-Read-Legal).

For illegal instruction fetch transactions, IOPMP reports error record using:

* Transaction type (*ERR_INFO.ttype*) = 0x03 "instruction fetch transaction"
* Error type (*ERR_INFO.etype*) = 0x03 "illegal instruction fetch"
