# IOPMP Reference Model Documentation

The **Input/Output Physical Memory Protection (IOPMP)** is a hardware component designed to control and validate accesses issued from bus initiators. It checks the validity of these accesses in real-time. The **IOPMP Reference Model** is developed in compliance with the **RISC-V IOPMP Specification Version 0.9.2-RC3 (January 2025)**. This model  will be updated with future specification revisions.

## IOPMP Model Overview

The IOPMP Reference Model includes several distinct configurations, each offering different levels of functionality and flexibility in controlling physical memory protection. The following table provides an overview of the available models:

| **Model Name** | **SRCMD_FMT** | **MDCFG_FMT** | **Description** |
|----------------|---------------|---------------|-----------------|
| **Full Model** | 0             | 0             | **Max Supported RRIDs:** 65536<br> **Max Supported MDs:** 63<br> Uses the RRID to obtain `SRCMD_EN(H)`, which indicates the associated MDs.<br> The `MDCFG` table is traversed to retrieve the associated MDs.<br> Associated IOPMP entries are extracted from the respective MD and traversed for address matching and permission checks. |
| **Rapid-k Model** | 0          | 1             | **Max Supported RRIDs:** 65536<br> **Max Supported MDs:** 63<br> Uses the RRID to obtain `SRCMD_EN(H)`, indicating the associated MDs.<br> There is no physical `MDCFG` table in this model. Each MD has *k* associated IOPMP entries.<br> IOPMP entries linked to the MD associated with the RRID are traversed for address matching and permission checks.<br> **IOPMP Entry Ranges for Each MD:**<br>  `MD0 → 0 to (k - 1)`<br>  `MD1 → k to (2k - 1)`<br>  `MD2 → 2k to (3k - 1)`, and so on. |
| **Dynamic-k Model** | 0        | 2             | Same as the **Rapid-k Model**, but the value of *k* is programmable. |
| **Isolation Model** | 1        | 0             | **Max Supported RRIDs:** 63<br> **Max Supported MDs:** 63<br> There is no physical `SRCMD` table. Instead, `RRID i` directly maps to `MD i`.<br> Associated IOPMP entries are extracted from `MD i` and traversed for address matching and permission checks. |
| **Compact-k Model** | 1        | 1             | **Max Supported RRIDs:** 63<br> **Max Supported MDs:** 63<br> There is no physical `SRCMD` table. `RRID i` directly maps to `MD i`.<br> There is no physical `MDCFG` table. Each MD has *k* associated IOPMP entries.<br> **Associated IOPMP Entry Ranges:**<br>  `(i × k)` to `((i + 1) × k - 1)` for address matching and permission checks. |
| **Unnamed Model 1** | 1 | 2           | Same as the **Compact-k Model**, but the value of *k* is programmable. |

| **Unnamed Model 3** | 2                   | 1             | **Max Supported RRIDs:** 32<br> **Max Supported MDs:** 63<br> `SRCMD_EN(H)` and `SPS` extension registers are replaced with `SRCMD_PERM(H)`.<br> There is no physical `MDCFG` table. Each MD has *k* associated IOPMP entries.<br> `SRCMD_PERM(H)` only defines permissions, not associated MDs. All IOPMP entries are traversed for address matching and permission checks. |
| **Unnamed Model 4** | 2                   | 2             | Same as **Unnamed Model 3**, but the value of *k* is programmable. |

## Reference Model Functions

These functions are designed for use within a testbench to input stimuli and obtain responses from the respective models:

1. **`int reset_iopmp()`**  
   Resets the IOPMP registers to their default values. The function returns 0 if the reference model is successfully initialized.

2. **`void write_register(uint16_t offset, reg_intf_dw data, uint8_t num_bytes)`**  
   Writes data to a memory-mapped register identified by the specified offset. The number of bytes written is specified by `num_bytes`. If the access is invalid, the write is ignored. The data type `reg_intf_dw` depends on the configuration in the `config.h` file (e.g., `uint32_t` for 4-byte width, `uint64_t` for 8-byte width).

3. **`reg_intf_dw read_register(uint16_t offset, uint8_t num_bytes)`**  
   Reads data from a memory-mapped register identified by the specified offset. The number of bytes to read is specified by `num_bytes`. If the access is invalid, the function returns zeros. The data type `reg_intf_dw` is dependent on the bus width defined in `config.h`.
   
4. **`int create_memory(uint8_t mem_gb)`**  
   Allocates memory of the specified size in gigabytes. mem_gb is used for the size of the memory to allocate in gigabytes. It returns 0 if the memory allocation was successful, -1 otherwise.

5. **`uint8_t read_memory(uint64_t addr, uint8_t size, char *data)`**  
   Read data from a specific memory address. The param addr is the memory address from where the data should be read. The param size is the size of the data in bytes. The pram data is the pointer to the data for read. It returns 0 if the read was successful, BUS_ERROR if the address corresponds to a bus error.

6. **`uint8_t write_memory(char *data, uint64_t addr, uint32_t size)`**  
   This function writes data to a specific memory address, the param data indicates Pointer to the data to write, the param addr is the memory address where the data should be written and param size will be the size of the data in bytes. it returns 0 if the write was successful, BUS_ERROR if the address corresponds to a bus error.

7. **`void configure_srcmd_n(uint8_t srcmd_reg, uint16_t srcmd_idx, reg_intf_dw data, uint8_t num_bytes)`**  
   This function is used for SRCMD Table Configurations. The param srcmd_reg could be SRCMD_EN, SRCMD_ENH, SRCMD_R, SRCMD_RH, SRCMD_W, SRCMD_WH. srcmd_idx could be any legal SRCMD table index, data contains the value that you want to write in this register. The number of bytes to write is specified by `num_bytes`. It could be 4-Byte write or 8-Byte Write.

8. **`void configure_mdcfg_n(uint8_t md_idx, reg_intf_dw data, uint8_t num_bytes)`**  
   This function is used for MDCFG Table Configurations. md_idx could be any legal MDCFG table index, data contains the value that you want to write in this register. The number of bytes to write is specified by `num_bytes`. It could be 4-Byte write or 8-Byte Write.

9. **`void configure_entry_n(uint8_t entry_reg, uint64_t entry_idx, reg_intf_dw data, uint8_t num_bytes)`**  
   This function is used for Entry Table Configurations. entry_idx could be any legal Entry table index, data contains the value that you want to write in this register. The number of bytes to write is specified by `num_bytes`. It could be 4-Byte write or 8-Byte Write.

10. **`void receiver_port(uint16_t rrid, uint64_t addr, uint32_t length, uint32_t size, perm_type_e perm, iopmp_trans_req_t *iopmp_trans_req)`**  
   This function contains receiver port signals, that will be passed to the iopmp, where rrid is RRID Of the Bus Initiator, addr is Address to be checked, length is length Number of transfers, size is It should be 0 for 1-byte, 1 for 2-byte, 2 for 4-byte access, perm is the permissions required for this transcation, iopmp_trans_req is a pointer, pass it as it is.

11. **`int error_record_chk(uint8_t err_type, uint8_t req_perm, uint64_t req_addr, bool err_rcd)`**  
   This could be used to check the error record register data. err_type is the ype of Error, req_perm contains the Requested permissions, req_addr contains the requested address, err_rcd indicated if Set if error should be recorded

## **Compilation and Simulation of IOPMP Models**

The **IOPMP Reference Model** is written in C and requires a GCC compiler for compilation. Follow these steps to compile and simulate:

1. Adjust the `config.h` file as needed to customize IOPMP configurations.
2. Use the following commands to compile:

   - **Compile All Models**:  
     ```bash
     make all
     ```
   - **Compile Specific Models**:  
     ```bash
     make build model=full_model        # Full Model  
     make build model=rapid_k_model     # Rapid-k Model  
     make build model=dynamic_k_model   # Dynamic-k Model  
     make build model=isolation_model   # Isolation Model  
     make build model=compact_k_model   # Compact-k Model  
     make build model=unnamed_model_1   # Unnamed Model 1  
     make build model=unnamed_model_2   # Unnamed Model 2  
     make build model=unnamed_model_3   # Unnamed Model 3  
     make build model=unnamed_model_4   # Unnamed Model 4
     ```

3. After compilation, binaries are generated in the `bin` folder and the library files are generated in `lib` folder.

## IOPMP Reference Model Test Files

The `verif` directory contains a `test` folder that includes test files for each of the 9 models. You can add custom tests to the relevant test file for your preferred model.
