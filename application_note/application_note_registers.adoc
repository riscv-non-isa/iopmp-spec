h|Field                         |Bits   |R/W    |Default    |Description
|{set:cellbgcolor:#FFFFFF}mdcfg_fmt |1:0    |R      |IMP        a|Indicate the MDCFG format

* 0x0: Format 0. MDCFG Table is implemented.

* 0x1: Format 1. No MDCFG Table. *HWCFG.md_entry_num* is fixed.

* 0x2: Format 2. No MDCFG Table. *HWCFG.md_entry_num* is programmable.

* 0x3: reserved.

Please refer to <<mdcfg-table-formats>> for details.
|{set:cellbgcolor:#FFFFFF}srcmd_fmt                      |3:2    |R      |IMP        a|Indicate the SRCMD format

* 0x0: Format 0. *SRCMD_EN(_s_)* and *SRCMD_ENH(_s_)* are available.

* 0x1: Format 1. No SRCMD Table.

* 0x2: Format 2. *SRCMD_PERM(_m_)* and *SRCMD_PERMH(_m_)* are available.

* 0x3: reserved.

Please refer to <<srcmd-table-formats>> for details.
|md_entry_num   |11:4  |WARL   |IMP     a| When *HWCFG0.mdcfg_fmt* = 

* 0x0: must be zero

* 0x1 or 0x2: *md_entry_num* indicates each memory domain exactly has (*md_entry_num* + 1) entries in a memory domain

*md_entry_num* is locked if *HWCFG0.enable* is 1.
|no_x|12:12  |R     | IMP| For *chk_x*=1, the IOPMP with *no_x*=1 always fails on an instruction fetch; otherwise, it should depend on *x*-bit in *ENTRY_CFG(_i_)*. For *chk_x*=0, *no_x* has no effect.
|no_w|13:13  |R     | IMP| Indicate if the IOPMP always fails write accesses considered as as no rule matched.
|rrid_transl_en                  |14:14    |R      |IMP        |Indicate the if tagging a new RRID on the initiator port is supported
|rrid_transl_prog                |15:15    |W1CS   |IMP        |A write-1-clear bit is sticky to 0 and indicate if the field rrid_transl is programmable. Support only for *rrid_transl_en*=1, otherwise, wired to 0.
|rrid_transl                     |31:16    |R   |IMP          |The RRID tagged to outgoing transactions. Support only for HWCFG0.rrid_transl_en=1.
