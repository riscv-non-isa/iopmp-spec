=== IOPMP Models
For the sake of convenience of discussion, some highly used combinations of *HWCFG0* have an alias name, which are *srcmd_fmt*=0 and *mdcfg_fmt*=0 as the full model, *srcmd_fmt*=0 and *mdcfg_fmt*=1 as the rapid-_k_ model, where _k_ = (*md_entry_num* + 1), *srcmd_fmt*=0 and *mdcfg_fmt*=2 as the dynamic-_k_ model, where _k_ = (*md_entry_num* + 1), *srcmd_fmt*=1 and *mdcfg_fmt*=0 as the isolation model, and *srcmd_fmt*=1 and *mdcfg_fmt*=1 as the compact-_k_ model, where _k_ = (*md_entry_num* + 1).

.an example block diagram of the rapid-4 model. The flow is the same as in <<IOPMP_BLOCK_DIAGRAM>>, except the MDCFG Table is simplified to a constant mapping illustrated in the dashed box. In this example, every MD has exactly four entries.

.an example block diagram of SRCMD Format 2. It illustrates the implementation of SRCMD Table Format 2 and MDCFG Table Format 1, where HWCFG0.md_entry_num is set to 0. In this example, each MD contains a single entry, meaning the entry index corresponds directly to the MD index.
